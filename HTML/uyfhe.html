			<h1>HOME</h1>
			A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors. In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.
			<br><br>
			 Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website; for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles. According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page. A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.

		<p id="about">
			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			The adverb about, when used with a quantity, means approximately or roughly. If a teenager wants to have a couple of friends over, his mom might ask about how many "a couple" is — in his mind it may be about 50.
     		 <br>
 		     <br>
  		    The adverb about can also be used for things that are almost, or just on the verge of happening. If you're about to graduate from high school, you're just finishing up your senior year. About also means around or on all sides. If you don't like animals, going to the petting zoo is a bad idea. The animals will be all about you.

  			<h1>CONTACT</h1>
  			A contact page is a common web page on a website for visitors to contact the organization or individual providing the website.
			<br>
			<br>
			This Contact Us page does two things well: it asks for only the information that is necessary (email address) and it displays a video that explains exactly how contacting the IMPACT team works. This is a helpful experience for the user especially if they are expecting a quick response.

		<p id="service">
			<h1>SERVICE</h1>
			In practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user. Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON, often through a Web service to allow syndication. Another application offered to the end-user may be a mashup, where a Web server consumes several Web services at different machines and compiles the content into one user interface.
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    A web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other web-related standards.
